This is a small Unity project that tests the Burst direct call feature that allows managed code to invoke burst-compiled functions without using a function pointer.
See the following manual page for details.

https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.5/manual/docs/CSharpLanguageSupport_Lang.html#directly-calling-burst-compiled-code

This feature is only available on Burst 1.5 or later.
